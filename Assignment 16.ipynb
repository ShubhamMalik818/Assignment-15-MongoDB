    "ANS- MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that is designed to store and manage unstructured data in a flexible and \n",

    "     of complex data structures and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular schema used in relational databases. \n",

    "ANS- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a document-oriented manner. \n",

    "\n",
    "    1. Document-oriented data model: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents that can have varying structures, \n",
    "                                      making it a good choice for handling unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",

    "                       the schema of your data on the fly, without any downtime or migration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Scalability: MongoDB is designed to be horizontally scalable, allowing you to scale out by adding more servers to a cluster. \n",

    "                          across multiple servers, providing high availability and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Rich query language: MongoDB provides a powerful query language with support for advanced features like aggregation, indexing, \n",
    "                            and geospatial queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Built-in sharding: MongoDB has built-in support for sharding, which allows you to partition your data across multiple servers, \n",
    "                          enabling you to handle even larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Flexible deployment options: MongoDB can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud, and supports a wide range of platforms and \n",
    "                                    programming languages.\n",
